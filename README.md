      : New party, new prod! "Heatseeker" is a demo 
      : about summer, or rather, the voyage from
        winter to summer. It was released on
        September 6th 2014 at AbelLan in Trondheim,
        where it won 1st place in the combined demo
        compo. The theme of the compo was "Summer".
  
      : The demo is a ~22MB single-file png.html
      : ready to be run in Google Chrome or Firefox.
        No special flags are required to run, be it
        from your local file storage, or directly
        from the web.
 
      : The graphics are a mix between THREE.js-
      : powered WebGL, custom 2D canvas rendering,
        glsl shaders and a touch of video
        compositing (I wish i could code that kind
        of water!). Most of the 3D models are
        sourced from tf3dm.com.
 
      : The music is a remix of Norwegian national
      : Eurovision junior 2005 ("MGPjr") winner
        Malin Reitan's "Sommer og Skolefri". The
        vocals were isolated using instrumental
        negation and frequency filtering, and
        features live guitar recordings.
 
      : The demo was coded using Ninjadev's new
      : demo tool called nin. It is open source
        and fully browser-based. You can check it
        out at https://github.com/ninjadev/nin .
        The source code for Heatseeker will also
        become available soon, at
        https://github.com/sigvef/heatseeker .
